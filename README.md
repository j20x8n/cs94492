SYSEN 5220 Fall 2024
Final Team Project
Overview
The final Project consists of three parts: project proposal, final project presentation, and final project report.    Project proposal is due (October 6th).    Progress presentations are scheduled on October 28th      and October 30th   .    Final project presentation is scheduled on December 4th   and    December 9th.    A final project report will be due about one week after the final project presentation (Dec 15th).    The goal of this course project is to help you to develop your own skills in system dynamic analysis, modeling, design and evaluation, via a team project experience of applying the system dynamics tools learnt from the class to solve real world problems.    Each team can have up to 3 students.    
Each group must clearly define a problem presumably of interest to you, and to the rest of the class.       Of course this assignment can make use of material from previous individual   problem definition and causal loop diagram exercises, but it should involve a re-envisioning of a “complex problem”.    
For simplicity, you should attempt   to envision models that include not more than half a dozen primary stocks.       The topic and your conceptualization of it, should determine the model structure.
File Names and Title
This project is broken down into four stage small projects.       Submissions for each stage should be provided to me in electronic form.    To simplify keeping track of these, use filenames with this format:    || <.> || || ||
|||| || .         
For example: W.Emily P1 Control Algae Growth.docx,    B.Aram P3 Increase Game Profit.mdl, R.Yitzy P4 Water Cleaning.mdl.
You   need to have a title for your project.
Detail
Stage One: Project Proposal
For the first stage of the assignment each group must provide a brief project proposal including the conceptualization of the model:1.   Define the purpose of the model.    What is the problem situation?    What is the imagined ideal situation, or if you prefer a situation that might be viewed as an overall future goal.2.   Define the model boundaries and identify key variables.    A list of model components in table format (indicating component type: stock, flow, auxiliary, constant; listing units of measurement for each variable; giving brief definitions of key variables which the average audiences need).    Give the appropriate time horizon that your model covers.3.   Reference modes.    Describe the behavior. of the key variables.    One or two reference mode graphs of what you think the primary variables should look like as time evolves.4.   Diagram the basic mechanisms (feedback loops) of the system and explain.
During the last half of the semester each group will work to create a full model   from this information… modified as necessary.
Please submit stage one proposal in word or pdf document with your Vensim program for CLDs.
Stage Two: Project Progress Presentation
Team Modeling Project progress presentation required of each team will include the elements in s代 写SYSEN 5220 Fall 2024SQL
代做程序编程语言tage one and model formulation, evaluation, and implementation.    Specifically,
1.   Convert diagrams to stock and flow equations
2.   Estimate and select parameter values
3.   Create the simulation model
A working model should be understandable to others without undue explanation.    In other words, somebody with a reasonable understanding of system dynamics modeling should be able to follow the workings and logic of your model.       To accomplish this, your team:
a.   must    follow the guidelines on naming conventions covered in class,
b.   must ensure model units are correct,
c.   should provide explanations for model components in the Vensim equation editor unless the purpose of the component is obvious.
Please submit stage two presentation in PowerPoint or pdf presentation file with your Vensim program for SFDs.
Stage Three: Project Final Presentation
Team Modeling Project final presentation required of each team will include the complete model of the team project.    Specifically, your model can:
1.   Test the dynamic hypothesis (the potential explanation of how structure is causing observed behavior)
2.   Test model behavior.
3.   Test model's responses to different policies
4.   Translate study insight to an accessible form   
Please submit stage three presentation in PowerPoint or pdf presentation file with your Vensim program for SFDs.
Stage Four: Final Project Report
A concise report covering the above (4 or 5 pages is probably sufficient, somewhat longer only if you prefer).
Please submit stage four report in word or pdf document with your finished Vensim programs.
Team Modeling Project Guidelines and suggestions:
Models should emphasize causality:    Why do things happen the way they do… not just calculations as to what happens.    Don’t try to calculate outcomes you already know will happen...    that is very boring.       Think instead about what causal links create the problematic situation you are investigating.       
By focusing on knowledge domains within your team’s fields of expertise, you should be able to minimize time needed to collect background information, and understanding.       You may, if necessary, make assumptions that you are not 100% sure about (e.g. use guesses or reasonably approximate values), as long as you state this where appropriate.       
Recall that feedback systems create unexpected or interesting behavior.    Not all models will exhibit this...…but you should look for and include feedbacks, feedback loops, that characterize your modeling task.
Most importantly, it is usually best to focus on, or at least start with, a generic big picture view, rather than working at a high level of detail.          Detail can be added later if desired.       Think of typical villages rather than “a village”, typical farmers rather than “a farmer”, vegetable markets in the region rather than a specific market, families rather than a specific family.       
Final note, please indicate if you are NOT willing to allow me to use your team project as potential class example in future teaching.
